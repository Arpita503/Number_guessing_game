Welcome to the Number Guessing Game, a fun and interactive Python project designed to challenge your guessing skills! The program picks a random number between 1 and 100, and your task is to guess the number within a limited number of attempts based on the selected difficulty level
Features ✨

Difficulty Levels:
Easy: 10 attempts to guess the number.

Win or Lose Outcome:
Celebrate your win when you guess correctly, or see the correct number when your attempts run out.

How to Play 🕹️
Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE.

Choose your difficulty level: "easy" or "hard."
